        content: "Hey everyone,\n\nI just had my on-site loop at a major tech company (think FAANG) for a Software Engineer L4 role and wanted to share my experience to help others prepare.\n\n**Day Structure:**\n- Morning: 2 coding rounds (45 mins each). Focus was heavily on data structures (trees, graphs, hashmaps) and algorithms (dynamic programming, sorting).\n- Afternoon: 1 system design round (60 mins) - asked to design a basic URL shortener, and 1 behavioral round (45 mins) with a hiring manager focusing on leadership principles and past project experiences.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- Practice LeetCode mediums/hards consistently. Don't just solve, understand the patterns.\n- Be able to articulate your thought process clearly, even if you don't arrive at the perfect solution immediately.\n- For system design, discuss trade-offs, scalability, and potential bottlenecks. Start high-level and dive deeper as requested.\n- Prepare STAR method examples for behavioral questions.\n\nOverall, it was challenging but fair. Preparation is key! Good luck to everyone else interviewing!",
